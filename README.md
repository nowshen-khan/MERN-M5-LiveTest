Use Bootstrap's grid system for creating the layout. Customize the appearance of the header, main content section, and footer using CSS.

Answer: I make a simple portfolio website for this test. 

Teacher Feedback: Great job on creating a simple webpage using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The header, main content section, and footer are all present and the layout is created using Bootstrap's grid system. However, the appearance of the elements could be further customized using CSS to make the webpage more visually appealing.
